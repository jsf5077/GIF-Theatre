welcome to The Gif Theatre!

This project is to demonstrate the ability to use the Giphy API to populate my webpage with gifs pulled from a search. The importance of this particular construct is the API and utilizing it for my page. This project was built in two halves. The first half was to successfully create an API key for my use on the Gihpy page. From there I needed to properly pull information from giphy into my page. Once I was able to pull data from my API and see it in a console log, the next step was to use that data being pulled. In this specific case, the data I was trying to pull was a gif search that was executed with buttons on my page. The buttons were dynamically from an array using jquery. The user also has the opportunity to create their own unique button in which their search gets added to the array and the buttons are refreshed. One last challenge was to make sure that after the button was clicked and the page filled with gifs, that the gifs were infact still images and didn't animate until clicked on. Simply put, I used an if else statement that swapped the search result between a still image and an actual gif as the user clicks on it.

A project like this is useful because it shows you how to utilize complex code from others into your own projects without having to create it from scratch. This is a very powerful asset as we see API's being used in almost everything we do on the web.

I highly suggest that you read up on API's if you are unfamiliar with them. Also, when you find an API you would like to use, be sure to look at their docummentation on how to impliment their API.
